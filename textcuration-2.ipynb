      "    MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed\n",

      "    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the\n",

      "    the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the\n",
      "    Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed\n",
      "    to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a\n",
      "    transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted\n",
      "    from the expression \"R-dot-bar sub n\" (nth smoothed value of derivative\n",

      "\n",
      "    MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December\n",
      "    of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a\n",

      "    with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide\n",

      "\n",
      "    MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective\n",
      "    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary\n",

      "\n",
      "    If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,\n",
      "    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly\n",

      "    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.\tIt is not enough\n",
