    "A lot of popular text analysis represent text using a bag-of-words model: they provide counts of words or phrases (which we'll call *lexical features*) as a way to quantitatively distinguish what shows up rarely, often, or together with other things. To make these processes work, we want to be able to generate counts of lexical features that both differentiate documents and that show up often enough to find consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our dataset: 20 Newsgroups\n",
    "\n",
    "To help explore this, we'll use 20 Newsgroups. This dataset dates back to the 1990s, where it became popular in the machine learning community as a classification dataset. The original premise was to collect 20,000 messages, 1,000 from each of twenty different newsgroups on Usenet, and to train machine learning models to predict which of the newsgroups a post was from. (If you're not familiar with Usenet, think of it as the 80's version of Reddit: newsgroups are devoted to particular topics, and messages were posted to everyone subscribed to that topic.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, some messages were cross-posted on multiple threads. With those removed, the dataset most people use has 18,828 posts. The newsgroups include topics ranging from different religions and atheism to motorcycles, science, sports, and gun rights. To keep things light, and since we're not really interested in actually classifying text today, I'll just pull the messages from `sci.space`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our lives easier to start, I'm going to make a small helper function to allow me to pull a message by its position among the 593 messages we will have to look at and print a reasonable sample of it. (They're pretty long.) By default, this will print the first 1000 characters of the newsgroup data I have pulled, but I've added some keyword arguments so I can do some different things with it later."

    "Usually, when I get to a point where sample documents look reasonable, I'll do something small and automatic to check for outliers. For example, I might want to verify there aren't any ridiculously long messages that have gotten left in! So let's plot out the counts of characters and words in each of these documents!\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, I haven't defined what a word is yet. But what we're really looking for is a really basic check for whether this document looks like plausible text. Plausible text in English has space-separated words that are an average of 4-5 letters long. So we're just going to split text everywhere there's a whitespace character (spaces, newline characters) and use those as \"words\" for now, even though that's not really what we probably want to consider as our set of features later. Because we're relying on features of English, we should note that we'd need other techniques for other languages - the definition of a long document in unspaced Chinese is not going to benefit from splitting text on spaces and will probably be shorter in number of characters."

    "It looks like these documents include long, multi-chapter reports. The nice thing is these appear to be legitimate text (often, outliers I run into in digital corpora are signs that something got garbled). Unfortunately, they are quite long. In some tasks, it might make sense to split the text into smaller \"pseudo-documents\" that will be treated as separate by the algorithm. Sometimes, this will be done just by splitting the text in terms of number of lines or words (e.g. \"break every 100 words\"). This has a risk of splitting text in weird places, though, so I often will do one of two things depending on what the text can support:\n",
    "1. If there are clear, nicely-formatted paragraphs, I'll use newline characters to split the text and then put some number of paragraphs in each pseudo-document. That number might be 1 for something like basic text classification, or something longer for a more narrative-focused analysis. (I use a lot of topic models, which tend to like 100-500 words.)\n",
    "2. If there aren't good paragraph boundaries, I'll use something that detects sentences to make similar but not uniform length text passages. We'll look more at this in a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look through this for a bit (spoiler for the above), you'll also notice there are some things that aren't quite cleaned up. For example, there are some extra headings that didn't get cleaned out in the second document. Let's go ahead and write some extra custom cleaning - since the formatting is quite specific, we should be able to remove these without too much inspection of documents to make sure we're not deleting something that isn't a header."

Depending on how we want to define our types, we could say that \"we\" and \"We\" are different types, with two tokens of type \"We\" and one of type \"we\". Quite often, we'll choose to *case fold*, or treat lowercase and uppercase words in English as the same. More often than not, that's implemented by just lower-casing all of our text.\n",

    "A nice way to get a quick initial cut of some counts of different lexical features is using a `CountVectorizer`, a class from `scikit-learn` that takes a list of strings and (a) tokenizes them and (b) stores all of those counts in a matrix, or 2-D data structure of counts for each document and type. Rather than defining how it does this, let's start by taking a look by just feeding it the whole clean collection:"

When we count words in text, we usually expect most types in our vocabulary not to show up in most places, so if we made a full matrix of data, we would have a whole bunch of 0s and a much smaller proportion of 1s. To help cope with the storage inefficiency that would have, `scikit-learn` uses a *sparse* representation of the data: for each nonzero value in the matrix, it stores the row, column, and value.

    "Right now, this system is using a regular expression to split text into alphanumeric sequences and punctuation sequences. We can see that it's including a lot of apparently random number sequences. These features aren't usually helpful for text analysis because they're too rare to be part of a meaningful pattern - they probably identify a specific author, thread, or message uniquely, but they don't tell us much else. Usually there are lots of these if we just count everything, so we may want to remove some of these unique elements.\n",

    "The other type of feature we might want to remove are words that aren't distinguishing because they're too common. We usually refer to these as `stopwords`. Stopwords refer to words that are ignored by a text processing system because they're not relevant to the task at hand. There are canonical lists circulated for particular languages - for instance, `Scikit-learn` has one built in for English:"

    "You might notice this list doesn't have any punctuation marks inside \"can't\" and \"couldn't\". Some lists don't have contractions at all, some have punctuation, and some are split by certain tokenizers into units like \"can\" and \"n't\". No stoplist is actually universal - they're adapted for choices of domain and tokenization scheme. If we wanted to remove these, we could use the argument `stop_words='english'` in the constructor of the `CountVectorizer`. But in general, I am skeptical about trusting these lists on their own, especially because they can remove interesting words (for instance, I think \"everywhere\" is a pretty interesting word!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we can alter our tokenization scheme. While we can give an alternate regular expression directly to the `CountVectorizer`, I like using NLTK's tokenization support, as they have nice interfaces for tokenization. NLTK Tokenizer objects, like the `RegexpTokenizer` below, have a `tokenize` method that takes in text and returns a list of tokens. The `CountVectorizer` is happy to take a tokenizer function in as an argument, so you can use [something fancier](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html) than a regular expression from NLTK if you want!"

    "One other cool thing our `CountVectorizer` supports is vocabulary curation. Rather than giving a stoplist, we can specify which word types we want to keep based on what proportion of documents they appear in. In this case, I'd like word types that show up in at least 5 documents but no more than 30% of all documents. I'll do this by setting `min_df=5` and `max_df=0.3`. Here, `df` is **document frequency**. If we give a positive integer for either of these, it'll use *absolute* document frequency, i.e. a count, as a threshold; if we give a float between 0 and 1, it will use that number as a proportion of the corpus, or *relative* document frequency threshold. Using this, we can prune our feature list dramatically, getting rid of both rare and common features."
