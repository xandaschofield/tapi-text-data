In this section, we're going to look more at unstructured text directly and how we can pre-process that text.

    "\n",
    "A lot of popular text analysis represent text using a bag-of-words model: they provide counts of words or phrases (which we'll call *lexical features*) as a way to quantitatively distinguish what shows up rarely, often, or together with other things. To make these processes work, we want to be able to generate counts of lexical features that both differentiate documents and that show up often enough to find consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our dataset: 20 Newsgroups\n",
    "\n",
    "To help explore this, we'll use 20 Newsgroups. This dataset dates back to the 1990s, where it became popular in the machine learning community as a classification dataset. The original premise was to collect 20,000 messages, 1,000 from each of twenty different newsgroups on Usenet, and to train machine learning models to predict which of the newsgroups a post was from. (If you're not familiar with Usenet, think of it as the 80's version of Reddit: newsgroups are devoted to particular topics, and messages were posted to everyone subscribed to that topic.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, some messages were cross-posted on multiple threads. With those removed, the dataset most people use has 18,828 posts. The newsgroups include topics ranging from different religions and atheism to motorcycles, science, sports, and gun rights. To keep things light, and since we're not really interested in actually classifying text today, I'll just pull the messages from `sci.space`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our lives easier to start, I'm going to make a small helper function to allow me to pull a message by its position among the 593 messages we will have to look at and print a reasonable sample of it. (They're pretty long.) By default, this will print the first 1000 characters of the newsgroup data I have pulled, but I've added some keyword arguments so I can do some different things with it later."

    "We're now missing some context of this text, so if we wanted to read and interpret these messages, this might be an issue. However, for a program, this is probably the content we want left: just the new authored natural language text of each message (mostly). But that's just for the ten documents we checked.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checking for outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, when I get to a point where sample documents look reasonable, I'll do something small and automatic to check for outliers. For example, I might want to verify there aren't any ridiculously long messages that have gotten left in! So let's plot out the counts of characters and words in each of these documents!\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, I haven't defined what a word is yet, in part because it's an ambiguous term in this setting. When we want to count lexical features in text, we usually are interested in splitting text into working units containing a word, phrase, punctuation mark, or another kind of countable occurrence that be distinguished on its own, the atoms of our larger model of language. We call these elements *tokens*, and the process of splitting *tokenization*. We often talk about counting words, but when we use a word counting tool to make sure we're under a limit for a submitted text, we're counting the number of word *tokens*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokens can share a *type*. For instance, let's look at how many times I said \"we\" in the last paragraph. Here are the possible candidates:\n",
    "* When *we* want...\n",
    "* ...in text, *we* usually...\n",
    "* *We* call these...\n",
    "* *We* often talk...\n",
    "* ...when *we* use a...\n",
    "* ...text, *we*'re counting...\n",
    "\n",
    "We could count this as six instances of the word type *we*. Or, we could choose to distinguish every surface form of the word as a type: *We*, *we*, and *we're* could be three separate forms tokens could have that we treat differently. Quite often, we'll choose to *case fold*, or treat lowercase and uppercase words in English as the same type. More often than not, that's implemented by just lower-casing all of our text. Depending on our system for tokenizing, we may also treat apostrophes as separating words, or not, or something more complex. (The Punkt tokenizers would tokenize \"didn't\" as `[\"did\", \"n't\"]`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, what we're really looking for is a really basic check for whether this document looks like plausible text. Plausible text in English has space-separated words that are an average of 4-5 letters long. So we're just going to split text everywhere there's a whitespace character (spaces, newline characters) and use those as \"words\" for now, even though that's not really what we probably want to consider as our set of features later. Because we're relying on features of English, we should note that we'd need other techniques for other languages - the definition of a long document in unspaced Chinese is not going to benefit from splitting text on spaces and will probably be shorter in number of characters."

      "satellites. Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be \n",
      "launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle \n",
      "launches. These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be \n",
      "launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches. Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a \n",
      "planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta. Although \n",
      "details of the launch services contract were reported to be \n",
      "negotiation, and not yet final. The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of \n",
      "their Delta II launcher. This contract is only initially worth $7.5 \n",

      "by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the \n",

      "request of WorldView. Most industry speculation identifies this new \n",
      "venture as a \"Star Wars\" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to \n",
      "provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into \n",
      "digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users. Most probable \n",
      "customers for this service include exploration geologists, \n",

      "November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote \n",
      "sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices. Prior to \n",
      "this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to \n",
      "all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures \n",

Rather than defining how it does this, let's start by taking a look by just feeding it the whole clean collection:"

    "If you were expecting to see the 2D structure of a matrix (with 593 documents as rows and >13k word types as columns), this might be a bit confusing. When we count words in text, we usually expect most types in our vocabulary not to show up in most places, so if we made a full matrix of data, we would have a whole bunch of 0s and a much smaller proportion of 1s. To help cope with the storage inefficiency that would have, `scikit-learn` uses a *sparse* representation of the data: for each nonzero value in the matrix, it stores the row, column, and value.

    "\n",
    "Right now, this system is using a regular expression to split text into alphanumeric sequences and punctuation sequences. We can see that it's including a lot of apparently random number sequences. These features aren't usually helpful for text analysis because they're too rare to be part of a meaningful pattern - they probably identify a specific author, thread, or message uniquely, but they don't tell us much else. Usually there are lots of these if we just count everything, so we may want to remove some of these unique elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other type of feature we might want to remove are words that aren't distinguishing because they're too common. We usually refer to these as `stopwords`. Stopwords refer to words that are ignored by a text processing system because they're not relevant to the task at hand. There are canonical lists circulated for particular languages - for instance, `scikit-learn` has one built in for English:"

    "You might notice this list doesn't have any punctuation marks inside \"can't\" and \"couldn't\". Some lists don't have contractions at all, some have punctuation, and some are split by certain tokenizers into units like \"can\" and \"n't\". No stoplist is actually universal - they're adapted for choices of domain and tokenization scheme. If we wanted to remove these, we could use the argument `stop_words='english'` in the constructor of the `CountVectorizer`. But in general, I am skeptical about trusting these lists on their own, especially because they can remove interesting words (for instance, I think \"everywhere\" is a pretty interesting word!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we can alter our tokenization scheme. While we can give an alternate regular expression directly to the `CountVectorizer`, I like using NLTK's tokenization support, as they have nice interfaces for tokenization. NLTK Tokenizer objects, like the `RegexpTokenizer` below, have a `tokenize` method that takes in text and returns a list of tokens. The `CountVectorizer` is happy to take a tokenizer function in as an argument, so you can use [something fancier](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html) than a regular expression from NLTK if you want!"

    "One other cool thing our `CountVectorizer` supports is vocabulary curation. Rather than giving a stoplist, we can specify which word types we want to keep based on what proportion of documents they appear in. In this case, I'd like word types that show up in at least 5 documents but no more than 30% of all documents. I'll do this by setting `min_df=5` and `max_df=0.3`. Here, `df` is **document frequency**. If we give a positive integer for either of these, it'll use *absolute* document frequency, i.e. a count, as a threshold; if we give a float between 0 and 1, it will use that number as a proportion of the corpus, or *relative* document frequency threshold. Using this, we can prune our feature list dramatically, getting rid of both rare and common features."

    "This looks like a lot more promising a list, as we have a lot of recognizable words!\n",
    "\n",
    "People sometimes ask me exactly what numbers to use here. Like everything, it depends, but for English or other language where morphology isn't going to affect stopwords too much, I would set the max_df to something between .3 and .5, with the idea that a word that shows up in more than a third of the corpus is probably not very specific. The minimum is going to depend heavily on the number of documents in your corpus - for a multi-million document corpus, I would probably want something like 1000 or more, whereas for a few hundred documents, I would worry about going much above 5 or 10. Usually, you can visually inspect your token list and figure out if your terms are too specific or too vague. If you can't find a threshold that eliminates gibberish tokens, it's probably worth revisiting if you need to clean out formulaic portions of text, ideally by searching in your corpus for examples of the tokens whose types you can't get rid of.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**: replace the tokenizer above with the function `nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize` (which you'll need to import). How does that change the behavior?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collocations: when one word won't do\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of domains have phrases whose meanings are distinct from their constituent words. For instance, while \"climate\" can refer to a community's social circumstance and \"change\" can refer to spare coins, \"climate change\" is probably not referring to either.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to simply consider all possible two-token sequences, or even longer sequences (we call a sequence of length *n* an *ngram*), we can use our CountVectorizer directly to do so: `ngram_range=(1,3)`, for example, would allow us to specify we want to consider as features all sequences of one, two, or three tokens that appear in the corpus as possible features. The same frequency thresholds as before can be applied. Unfortunately, this tends to explode the size of our features in a way that usually includes way more ngrams we don't care about than ngrams we do. In some text processing circumstances, it makes sense to limit ourselves sequences of words for specific entities with a distinct meaning, like a noun phrase or figure of speech. We can automate that process using programs that count how often word pairs, or *bigrams*, appear compared to their single word, or *unigram* pieces. If they show up together way more than randomly, we might treat that as a collocation and a separate item in our lexicon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing these finders from scratch is a pain. Lucky for us, NLTK actually has a BigramCollocationFinder built in, which allows us to specify a metric for finding collocations. I often use PMI, or [pointwise mutual information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointwise_mutual_information). Usually, it helps to couple this with something that discards particularly rare bigrams: for instance, if the only octopus mentioned in the corpus is blue, then we might find \"blue octopus\" marked as a high-PMI bigram even though it's rare.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**: Look at the top 100 collocations found using PMI. What sorts of things do these bigrams capture? What happens if you change the frequency threshold from 5 to something else?"

    "Earlier, we alluded to the process of deciding which tokens to treat as having the same type (for instance, we might decide \"We\" and \"we\" are the same type, even though they have different capitalization - a case of *case folding*). There are lots of things that might affect what we decide counts as the same type or not:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We may want to distinguish the part of speech of a word, so \"bank\" (the noun) is different from \"bank\" (the verb)\n",
    "* We may want to combine different morphologies with the same root or *lemma*, such as treating \"lift\", \"lifts\", and \"lifted\" as the same\n",
    "* We may want to conflate all punctuations symbols that end sentences as one token (e.g., *PUNCT*)\n",
    "* We may want to treat all numeric tokens of the same length (e.g. 1975 -> ####, 2 -> #)\n",
    "\n",
    "For deciding when to do these things, it's always worth thinking about what your research question and how this will affect it. For instance, when deciding whether to conflate words with the same root, you can use a heuristic called a *stemmer* or a lookup table called a *lemmatizer* to replace words with their root forms. If you're interested in when people mention climate change, that's probably reasonable, as you might want to make sure \"environment, \"environmental\", etc. are all treated similarly. However, if you're doing something on comparative religions, treating \"god\" and \"gods\" as the same is probably not a good idea! Usually, when in doubt, it's good to be conservative - even if features look like duplicates and make it harder to read through, if you can run your analysis with more features, try doing so first and see if the increase in different word forms is actually interfering with what the model gets out at the document level. (For English topic models, both stopwords and stemmers don't change much!)\n",
    "\n",
    "A note: when you do processing to change these things, it can affect the steps taken by other processing units. For instance, lemmatizers use surrounding context to figure out the form of a word, so if you change capitalization or remove stopwords, that can mess your lemmatizer up. Luckily, there's a tool that can manage a pipeline of different processing steps for you called `spaCy`, which includes lots of different token-level processing tools and models for different languages. Let's see an example of how `spaCy` represents tokens with a model trained on web and social media data:"

    "This is a *lot* to unpack, and isn't even everything, but we can translate these lines to tell us about a lot of properties of a token `tok`:\n",
    "* `tok.idx` tells us at what index, or position, the first character of that token has within the string (e.g. the \"HOW\" at the start of \"HOW TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT\" is the 73rd character of the document)\n",
    "* `tok.lemma` tells us the root or lemmatized form of a word (e.g. at index 368, the lemma of \"paying\" is \"pay\"). These are inferred using a combination of contextual information and a lookup table. A *stemmer* is a rule-based program that tries to guess lemmas quickly using syntax rules, and will run both faster and with more errors than a lemmatizer - but neither system is perfect.\n",
    "* `tok.is_alpha` tells us whether the token is all letters or not (punctuation, dates, and times are not alphabetical)\n",
    "* `tok.is_punct` tells us if a token is punctuation.\n",
    "* `tok.is_stop` tells us if a token is part of the stoplist for this spaCy language model (here, one built for web and social media, which we can see includes all of \"How\", \"do\", \"I\", \"become\", and \"an\" but not \"astronaut\"\n",
    "* `tok.pos_` tells us the part of speech of a tag based on the Universal POS tag set, a standard set used in many natural language processing systems and evaluations. These are automatically inferred, sometimes incorrectly - see at index 90, where ASTRONAUT is inferred to be an adjective modifying \"First\".\n",

    "..a lot more of these `is_` checks exist for things ranging from whether a token is at the start of end of a sentence to if it's referring to currency or is a piece of left-side punctuation. I recommend checking out the [Token documentation](https://spacy.io/api/token) for the full list. The key of this, though, is that this processing scheme can allow you to rewrite your text into tokens that encode all the information you care about. For instance, if I want to count word types defined based on the intersection of a word's lemma and its part of speech, I could do something like:"

    "At this point, we've seen how we can break text into the tokens we care about, and recombine and modify those tokens. We also looked at using Counters and plots to quickly grasp the distribution of common quantities in our data and to spot outliers. I haven't answered a lot of questions about what the right process to tokenize and process this text is, because there isn't one set process: it's usually good to keep inspecting as you try things, or to compare several options at once on a few sample documents to get a good sense of what works. But again, when in doubt, be conservative - don't throw information away that you might use.\n",
