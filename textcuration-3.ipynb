    "**Audience:** `Learners` / `Researchers`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use case:** [`How-To`](https://constellate.org/docs/documentation-categories#howtoproblemoriented) \n",

    "**Difficulty:** `Intermediate`\n",
    "Assumes users are familiar with Python and have been programming for 6+ months. Code makes up a larger part of the notebook and basic concepts related to Python are not explained.\n",

    "## Rough topic models for rough-draft datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "When I don't know much about a dataset, one of the first things I'll often do is train an LDA topic model on it - sometimes before many of the steps we've talked about in the other two lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would I do that? Well, first, let's briefly talk about what an LDA topic model does. If you haven't run into these before, I recommend sources like [Lisa Rhody's Digital Humanities article](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-1/topic-modeling-and-figurative-language-by-lisa-m-rhody/) and [Ted Underwood's blog post](https://tedunderwood.com/category/methodology/topic-modeling/) to get some of the intuitions. Once you've gotten at the intuition of these models, it can be good to dig into tutorials, like the existing [topic modeling course on Constellate](https://constellate.org/tutorials/topic-modeling) or other variations online, to explore what you can do with these.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, in this context, a *topic* is just a probability distribution of words (for instance, a topic could have high probabilities of the words \"great\", \"cool\", and \"fun\" and low probabilities of the words \"boring\", \"dinosaur\", and \"edward\"). Every topic will have at least some tiny probability of every word in the vocabulary of the text collection, but there should be a small subset of the vocabulary with high probability and very little probability of the majority of the vocabulary. A topic *model* describes a collection of texts using a fixed number of different topics: each document is described as having proportions of each topic, and each topic is described as having proportions of each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "To *infer* a topic model is to run an algorithm that knows the list of documents and the words in them (think of the data in our CountVectorizer - no order information, just word counts) and to try to find a fixed number of topics that can best describe the actual words present in the documents when combined together. Not all documents necessarily have one dominant topic - a document #372 could be 15% about topic 1, 80% about topic 2, and ~5% distributed over everything else. However, our topic model is working well if between topics 1 and 2, we get high probabilities of the words that actually show up in document #372, and likewise for the topics present in each of our other documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "A topic model has two major outputs: topic-word distributions, which describe how often each word shows up in each topic, and document-topic distributions, which describe the topic breakdown of each document. The nice thing is that all we need to infer one of these models is some way to get word counts by document (again, our CountVectorizer is great at that) and some existing code that trains a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, since finding the \"best\" topics is an impossibly hard math problem, we instead have programs that use randomness and iteration to eventually converge to \"good\" topics. You should expect the outputs of standard topic modeling software to change each time you run it. But that aside, usually you'll see some shuffling of topic order and the order of top words in each topic but a fair amount of consistency in what topics and words are present.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, hot take time: most people training topic models in Python will probably turn to a library called `gensim`. I'm instead using the implementation that's built into scikit-learn, not because it's better (the interface is actually worse) but because\n",
    "1. we've been using sklearn already, and\n",
    "2. while gensim has nicer interfaces for some parts of this, both scikit-learn and gensim don't train good LDA topic models on normal-size text collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "What? That's right - with the libraries currently available, I do not recommend using Python to train topic models for your actual analysis. Both gensim and scikit-learn use a strategy called batch/online LDA to find the \"best\" topic model for a corpus that is meant to work well for very large collections (think millions of documents). On even tens of thousands, the topics they learn tend to be pretty iffy. Without digging into the math of why, when you train a topic model on a non-massive corpus, you probably want to use something that says \"MCMC\" or \"Gibbs sampling\" in how it does inference. [MALLET](https://mimno.github.io/Mallet/) (a command-line tool) and the R package [topicmodels](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/topicmodels/index.html) both support this and will give you better analyses and have plenty of tutorials available online. If you want help getting MALLET set up, check out [Melanie Walsh's tutorial](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/05-Text-Analysis/06-Topic-Modeling-Overview.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're in Python-land for this tutorial and just exploring how to use topic models to notice if something's up with the corpus, we'll make do with what we've got. Let's train a 25-topic model and pull out our document-topic and topic-word information."

In English, \"the\", \"was\", etc. are likely to be important to remove before training, but most won't affect what happens to the rest of the text...so you can just write a function like the one below to ignore those words after the fact.

    "Topic models are very good at finding words that show up together, which is actually a perk for us when we're cleaning a text collection: if there's a systematic issue that causes repeated text to appear or that means a subset of the data is fundamentally very different from the rest, the topic model will almost always put the words that indicate that issue together in a topic. Since topic models try to represent the whole text as well as possible, even when things are working well, we expect some topics may not look interesting - but if you see sequences of words that aren't just boring but actually puzzling (or if you're trying to label topics) it's always important to go look at the documents!\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, we wrap up this brief overview of text curation. One thing we didn't do in this lesson that I'd hoped to was to show that the use of a model to detect issues in data isn't limited to topic models: supervised text classifiers like Naive Bayes classifiers learn weights on how much certain features matter, so one could train a classifier to predict which reviews are fresh versus rotten, then inspect whether some of the words that are considered good indicators of that are indicating a systamtic issue. If you have time to explore more, I recommend checking out [Susan Li's tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-class-text-classification-with-scikit-learn-12f1e60e0a9f) for an idea of how to use scikit-learn's multinomial Naive Bayes classifier `MultinomialNB` to do analyses."
