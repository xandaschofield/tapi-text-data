    "\n",
    "This is lesson 3 of 3 in the educational series on Text Data Curation. This notebook is intended to look at how trained models, such as naive Bayes models and topic models, can actually help the text curation process. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Audience:** `Learners` / `Researchers`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use case:** [`How-To`](https://constellate.org/docs/documentation-categories#howtoproblemoriented) \n",
    "\n",
    "**Difficulty:** `Intermediate`\n",
    "Assumes users are familiar with Python and have been programming for 6+ months. Code makes up a larger part of the notebook and basic concepts related to Python are not explained.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Completion time:** `90 minutes`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Knowledge Required:** \n",
    "* Python basics (variables, flow control, functions, lists, dictionaries)\n",
    "* How Python libraries work (installation and imports)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Knowledge Recommended:**\n",
    "* Basic file operations (open, close, read, write)\n",
    "* How text is stored on computers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "After this lesson, learners will be able to:\n",
    "1. Use a lexicon to retrieve interesting documents\n",
    "2. Get a basic scikit-learn classifier running\n",
    "3. Use a simple topic model to check for oddities in a corpus\n",
