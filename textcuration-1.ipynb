Here, we will look specifically at the ways we store text and collections of documents on computers and tools we can use to filter those larger collections into something usable. The tutorial is targeted at individuals interested in computational text analysis who are acquainted with the basics of programming in Python but are still new to developing models of text or more complex natural language processing tasks."

    "## When text is data\n",
    "There are lots of ways to gain understanding of texts. We can read the texts themselves closely, read about the history of the texts' subject and of its authors, dig up related or contemporary texts, and grapple with the critical responses others have had to each. Depending on the questions we want to answer or our worldview about textual analysis in general, we might take a mixture of these different strategies together to analyze, answer, and argue on one topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational text analysis provides another set of strategies to do this, with a specific emphasis on what is (or isn't) a pattern across numerous texts. To do this, text collections are fed to computer programs that count, contrast, and correlate events that happen in texts, ranging from the basic frequencies of individual words and phrases to more complex inferences of what events occur for a particular character or what sentiments or moods are prevalent around mentions of a specific theme. Approaches to find these patterns range from direct programming (e.g. writing code in Python or R) to interacting with visual interfaces (like Voyant or Tableau) to options that merge the two (like building an extensive spreadsheet in Excel).\n",
    "\n",
    "In my experience, there's an amazing ecosystem of different tools and tutorials out there to train models, compute statistics, and visualize results around text: it's just a matter of getting the text you care about into the right state to be usable by that system. And that's where **text data curation** comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "I define **text data** to be a structured format of textual information (that is, sequences of symbols that encode human language) intended for use in some kind of processing and computation. When we treat text as data, we have to enforce a certain degree of uniformity in how this text looks so the processing can be consistent. Most human-generated text collections, however, are not so tidy, no matter where they come from, who collected them, or what journey the text took to become a modern-day record. To succeed in text data analysis, we need to be able to grapple with this non-uniformity, to **curate** what text stays, how to store it, and how to transform it into something uniform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we're going to focus primarily on the first two questions: how to select the documents to keep and what representations are convenient for storing that text."

    "\n",
    "Suppose I'm interested in studying dominant themes in contemporary Spanish language poetry. To start, I want to find a large collection of these poems. I find out that the website [Poemas del Alma (\"Poems of the Soul\")](https://www.poemas-del-alma.com/) has hundreds of thousands of user-submitted poems from 2009 onwards. I also find an existing script written in Python to scrape the literary poems on the website, which I could adapt to get the user poems as well."

    "If you want, you can try these out and explore the differences in how this renders files. CSV files rely on quote characters and commas to separate out fields, which comes with a bit of danger for text processing, since commas show up quite often in text. CSV files will typically use a double quote `\"` as an *escape character* to define the boundaries of text so that commas inside a piece of text aren't read as the end of a column. This, in turn, produces interesting quirks for how to render quotes. If you use Python's `csv` library, it should take care of all of that for you, defaulting to the same behavior as what Microsoft Excel does, as specified by the default argument `dialect='excel'`. If you want to change this to another structure, I would recommend against trying to code it yourself, since it's easy to introduce errors, and instead check what dialect makes the most sense to use - you can even find Excel's official tab-separated value dialect!"

    "Surprised? Probably not - we spent extra space in our JSON representation to rewrite the names of our \"columns\" in every entry, and in the pretty printing, we also added bonus spaces. Of course, because of this format, JSON also has some flexibility we're not using: for instance, we can nest lists and objects inside other lists and objects, in the same way we could make a Python dictionary a value inside a Python dictionary. We can also choose to have some \"keys\" or attributes exist only some of the time; maybe if I had an author profile page for some authors but not others, I could add that attribute only where I need it in the JSON representation, but I would have to consistently have that column exist whether populated or not in the TSV representation. But it's worth talking about space because when we're representing data on computers in general, space adds up!\n",
    "\n",
    "To break this down a little more, let's review how strings store data. (I say review because I believe some of this is covered in the Intro to Python sequence for TAP.) A string is a list of characters, or symbols. Since computer memory is built to store information as binary numbers, a string is stored as a list of binary numbers, with one number for each character we see, which we call that symbol's *code point*. For instance, for pretty much any computer you'll use, the letter `A` has code point 65 if we're counting in base ten, and `a` has code point 97.\n",
    "\n",
    "A listing of these numbers is a *standard* - these numbers both come from the [ASCII standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII), or American Standard Code for Information Interchange, which dates back to the '60s. The ASCII standard is a product of its place and time: it goes from 0 to 127 and, fitting the expectations of popular characters for US English, it includes numbers, Latin letters without accents, punctuation, spacing, and a series of special symbols meant to match up to different typewriter operations. (After all, back in the 60's, typewriters were a standard way to handle input and output for computers.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard we interact with commonly online and on our phones is the [Unicode standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode). Unicode starts with the same 128 symbols as ASCII, but then extends well beyond that to include characters from other alphabets, diacritical marks, stylized symbols, and even emoji. It's also updated annually by the Unicode Consortium, a non-profit whose voting members comprise many well-known tech companies and research organizations. At the time of producing this tutorial, [Unicode 15.0 is about to be rolled out with over 149,000 characters](https://home.unicode.org/unicode-15-0-beta-review/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this gets at the way we map symbols to numbers, but to actually encode text - that is, to write it into our computer files and memory - we need a way to turn those numbers into a consistent sequence of ones and zeros. We call this a text encoding. Unicode actually has several different ways to do this.\n",

    "Python will get upset if we try to paste non-ASCII characters into a string, so to specify those characters as Unicode, we use the `\\u####` format to specify the code point of the symbol we want in *hexadeximal*.

The hexadecimal number 10 is equivalent to the decimal number sixteen. So, to write the decimal number forty-two, we'd use two sixteens and a ten, which we're write as 2A (2\\*16 + 10). If we wanted to write out sixteen squared in hexadecimal, we could just write 100, the same way 100 in our usual decimal counting system is ten squared.
